I’m a dedicated Statistician & Data Scientist (M.Sc.) leading a **multidisciplinary team** in the Statistics area at the **Institute of Intercultural Studies (IEI)**.

Currently, I oversee geospatial analysis, interactive dashboards, and ML modeling, working closely with academia, government, and **rural communities**.

In 2021, our team at IEI was honored with the **CIDESCO Award for Innovation** for the "Colombia Nos Duele, Javeriana Cali Propone" platform—recognizing our contribution in synthesizing statistical, qualitative, and geospatial data to support public dialogue during the national protests.

Previously, I led large-scale demographic and environmental studies and contributed to numerous policy- and community-oriented research initiatives.
